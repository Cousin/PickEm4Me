# PickEm4Me

CURRENT STATUS: 6-0 , no buy-backs needed still alive!

PickEm4Me is a little program I made to help me decide which team I will pick for a NFL Survivor Pool

A Survivor Pool (or at-least the one I joined) works like this

Every week, you pick a team that you think will win the game they play that week.
The only catch though is you can't pick the same team twice!
But you cannnn always pick the team playing the worst team

This program scrape(s/d) data from the NFL API and compares teams based on their Power Rankings.

The method I am using (method #1 referenced in PickEm4Me.java) finds the highest power ranking difference game for the week and picks it.

Feel free to use any of the data or methods provided, credit would be appreciated :D
